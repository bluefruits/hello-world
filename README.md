# Parry Printer
# As a fencer, this code is made to cycle through the parries that I practice each day. There are 9 parries in total in the system that I am using, and there is required user input for the repetitions and the interval time in between parries. 
# The parries are random. Currently, there is no option to choose which parries to display, only all 9 of them.
