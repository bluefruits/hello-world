# Parry Printer
# As a fencer, this code is made to cycle through the parries that I practice each day. There are 9 parries in total in the system that I am using. User input is required for the amount of 'Repetitions' and the speed in which the parry number stays on the screen. 
# Currently, the parries are set to random between 1-9. The Parry Printer will run through your repetitions and then display an encouraging message at the end!
